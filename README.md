# Vehicle Component Library
  
This repository includes a component library for total vehicle simulations. It is developed at the Institute of Automotve Engineering and contains all relevant components for longitudinal full vehicle simulations. The repoisitory includes one longitudinal simulation model, which is parameterized with a parameter set of a real prototype vehicle and simulated with four different driving cycles. The scematic structure of the model is shown below.

The repository realizes an approach to a modular system simulation. The aim is to gain modularity by making parts of the simulation exchangeable and reusable, by introducing independent components for each part of the simulation. The main idea is to combine pre-processing routines, such as parameter calculation tools and the simulation model, in one component. Thanks to defined boundary conditions, encapsulation and uniform interfaces, a concept has been developed that can be used to create different vehicle models and topologies. The interfaces allow components to exchange parameters as well as signals. 
The included library contains all relevant components for longitudinal full vehicle simulations. The repoisitory also includes one simulation model which is parameterized with a parameter set of a real prototype vehicle and simulated with four different driving cycles. The repository is explained in detail in the corresponding article by Danquah [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benedikt_Danquah).

  
## Getting Started

To get started after downloading the repository matlab has to be opened. The repository must be in the Matlab path. To start the a simulation run the script "Start\_FullVehicle\_Simulation\_SmartFortwo.m". The script opens the longitudinal simulation model SmartFortwo, Parameterize it, run it and show the results.

  
### Prerequisites
To run the code Matlab 2018b or newer is required. Matlab can be downloaded [here](https://de.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/). Additionally the repository needs to be downloaded at [FTM-Repository](www.github.com/TUMFTM/Component_Library_for_Full_Vehicle_Simulations) 
  
### Installing
After the repository is downloaded at  [FTM-Repository](www.github.com/TUMFTM/Component_Library_for_Full_Vehicle_Simulations) it needs to be unpaced in a folder of choice. 
  

  
### Running the Model/Code

To run the code Matlab must be started. Browse to the folder where the repository was unpaced and add the folder to the Matlab Path. By running the script "Start\_FullVehicle\_Simulation\_SmartFortwo.m" the simulation starts. to run the script type following command in the command line
  
```
\>> Start_FullVehicle_Simulation_SmartFortwo.m
```
