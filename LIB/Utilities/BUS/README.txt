Be carefull when you edit the BUS-Library.

The Blocks disconnect themselves from their link. If changes are made to the BUS_IN, 
you have to copy the new BUS_IN to the BUS_Subsystem and
replace the old BUS_IN within the BUS_Subsystem. 
Then you have to replace the BUS_Subsystem in the BUS_Lib. 
Same applies to any other changes made to the library blocks.
